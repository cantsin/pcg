# Procedural Content Generation

A test-bed for various procedural content generation algorithms in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). This project relies on various [Piston](http://www.piston.rs/) libraries.

I also follow the [PCG Book](http://pcgbook.com/) as a rough guideline for ideas and implementations. Currently Chapter 2 (utilizing a `μ + λ` evolutionary strategy) is implemented.

Sample results:

A random phenotype: ![Random Phenotype](/screenshots/random-sample.png)
A "list of walls" phenotype: ![List of Walls Phenotype](/screenshots/list-of-walls-sample.png)
A "wall pattern" phenotype: ![Wall Pattern Phenotype](/screenshots/wall-pattern-sample.png)
A "desirable properties" phenotype: ![Desirable Properties Phenotype](/screenshots/desirable-properties-sample.png)
