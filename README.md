# Procedural Content Generation

A test-bed for various procedural content generation algorithms in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/). This project relies on various [Piston](http://www.piston.rs/) libraries.

I also follow the [PCG Book](http://pcgbook.com/) as a rough guideline for ideas and implementations. Currently most of Chapter 2 (utilizing a `μ + λ` evolutionary strategy) is implemented.
